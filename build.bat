REM  EDVR build
REM
REM  Produces:
REM    build\d3d11.dll        native OpenXR graphics and fixes
REM    build\openvr_api.dll   native OpenXR compatibility ABI for Elite
REM    build\openxr_loader.dll   pinned Khronos loader; Windows selects runtime
REM
REM  Needs Visual Studio 2022 C++ and Python. Fetch the pinned loader once with
REM  python tools\fetch_openxr_loader.py. The build verifies it offline.
REM
REM  Usage:  build.bat [--clean] [--jobs N]
REM
REM  Once the DLLs are built, the test rigs run concurrently, --jobs at a time
REM  (default: one per logical core), through tools\run_jobs.py. Each rig is a
REM  :rig_<label> subroutine at the end of this file; the runner starts it as
REM  "build.bat --rig <label>", a child that inherits this build's environment
REM  and runs that one subroutine. --rig is the runner's, not for hand use.

REM The version baked into both DLLs, printed in the second line of every log.
REM
REM `git describe` rather than a hand-maintained constant, because the constant
REM would be wrong exactly when it matters: isolating which release a field log
REM came from used to mean correlating the link stamp against tag dates by hand
REM (done during the 2026-08-18 OpenXR Toolkit triage, twenty minutes for a
REM fact the DLL always knew). A clean tag prints as v0.7.3; a dev build names
REM itself v0.7.3-2-g650d8a9 and uncommitted changes append -dirty, so a log
REM from a build that was never a release SAYS so instead of impersonating one.
REM No git or no repo (a source-zip build) falls back to "unknown" and the
REM build carries on -- versioning must never be the reason a build fails.

REM A -dirty build is fine to make and dangerous to SEND, so say so loudly.
REM
REM The version is stamped here, at compile time, from the tree as it stands.
REM Build-then-commit therefore bakes in the pre-commit describe, and the
REM binary afterwards disagrees with what `git describe` says -- which is
REM exactly what happened twice on 2026-08-30, once reaching a field tester
REM whose logs then reported a version that did not exist. The binary was
REM correct both times; only its name was wrong, which on a support path is
REM its own kind of wrong.
REM
REM Not an error: building a dirty tree is the normal inner loop, and
REM refusing it would make the guard the thing people work around. It is a
REM line you cannot miss in the output when you are about to hand the file
REM to somebody.

REM Every cl.exe call below compiles its sources across all cores. cl.exe
REM prepends the CL environment variable to its own command line, so this one
REM setting covers every invocation, the 103-file d3d11 compile included, and

REM none of which are used; cl.exe refuses the combination out loud rather
REM than misbehaving. Measured 2026-09-15 on an 8-thread Ryzen: the d3d11.dll
REM section went from 53 s to 17 s, and with the shader reuse above the whole
REM build went from 365 s to 233 s, every gate green.

REM on purpose: its TIF helper (ffx_dx11.cpp) answers a failed D3D11 call
REM inside ffxFsr3UpscalerContextCreate/Dispatch -- both extern "C" -- with a
REM bare `throw 1`. Under /EHsc the try/catch in src\d3d11\fsr3_engine.cpp is
REM not required to run and the process fail-fasts instead (the review of
REM 2026-09-16, F2; the STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN signature in the design
REM doc's journal is that fail-fast). The flag covers every object in this
REM compile, not just fsr3_engine.cpp; the cost is unwind tables around

REM was REMOVED from the list is the only thing in that directory a build did

REM was deleted, its .obj stayed, and the link failed on three symbols it

REM ===========================================================================
REM  Test rigs. Each is a subroutine that tools\run_jobs.py runs in its own
REM  "build.bat --rig <label>" child, several at a time, once the DLLs above
REM  are built. A child jumps here from :args_done with the parent's
REM  environment: ROOT, BUILD, OBJ, GEN, CFLAGS, EDVR_VER, the
REM  INSTALLER_* lists and the compiler on PATH. Rigs run in any order and at the
REM  same time as one another, so a rig must not depend on another rig's
REM  output, must not share an obj directory, and must not write a file
REM  another rig reads. The DLLs a rig copies are the main flow's, above.
REM
REM  A rig named in --quiet (or --serial, see tools\run_jobs.py) is written
REM  in two steps so that only its test runs are held back:
REM      :rig_<label>
REM      if "%EDVR_RIG_STEP%"=="run" goto <label>_run
REM      ... compiles ...
REM      if "%EDVR_RIG_STEP%"=="build" exit /b 0
REM      :<label>_run
REM      ... runs ...
REM      exit /b 0
REM  The runner recognises the exact "build" guard line, runs the rig once
REM  with EDVR_RIG_STEP=build beside everything else and once more with
REM  EDVR_RIG_STEP=run under the group's rule. Without the guard the whole rig
REM  runs under the rule. The run label must not start with rig_.

REM Build gate for engine-record velocity (part of fix.temporal_aa, phase 1;
REM docs\kinematic-motion-injection-2026-09-19.md, 2026-09-23): the DXBC
REM patcher end to end on WARP (patched pool-family shaders disassemble,
REM reflect, create and DRAW the exact slot and depth at MRT6), the emit
REM bracket against a fake engine laid out as build 332841 (previous pose,
REM self-checking marker, the disagreement gate, the table), and the
REM compose's arithmetic from the shipped HLSL text against a double
REM reference. A parser or patcher that drifts fails here, not in a flight.
REM Since the 2026-09-23 fix round it also links engine_velocity.cpp itself
REM (EDVR_ENGINE_VELOCITY_RIG: no engine image to verify; the binding shadow
REM external) and drives its draw half through the flight's and the review's
REM cases -- cb1 re-maps, interleaved eyes, source swaps, pool writes, blend
REM states, depth formats, the stand-down -- plus the temporal pass's
REM compute-state save, sentinel by sentinel.

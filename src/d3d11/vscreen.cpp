//
// What differs from resolving per draw is only the bargain every

// its resource for its lifetime, so a second resolve can disagree with the
// first only if the object at that address changed with no hooked set in
// between -- an unbind through an unhooked path, a release and a reuse of the
// address, all inside one frame, because the frame boundary bumps every
// generation. And if the resolver's fault budget runs out mid-generation, a

// THE STALENESS DETECTOR, and it is the one measurement this whole arc still

//
// In the private-copy mode the object dispatches through a table EDVR froze at
// install, while Windows' d3d11.dll goes on re-laying the REAL table inside the
// context object every frame. The question nobody has answered is whether those
// two ever say different things. If they do not -- if the runtime writes the
// same pointers back forever -- the frozen copy is harmless and the crash on
// two users' rigs is something else. If they DO, the game is calling last
// second's implementation with this second's state, which is exactly how a GPU
// gets wedged, and the crash has its mechanism.
//
// Everything measuring this so far has been a once-a-second sample taken after
// Present. That is three samples on a rig that dies in 1.7 seconds, it cannot
// see a value that changes and changes back within a frame, and the eye-draw
// counts (243 patched in place versus 682 copied) say the re-lay lands about a
// third of the way THROUGH a frame -- exactly where a post-Present sample is
// blind. So this asks at the only moment that settles it: the instant before
// the call is forwarded.
//
// One load and one compare, on the draw path, only in copy mode. The first
// mismatch goes to the BREADCRUMB file as well as the log, because that file is
// written unbuffered and survives the process being killed by a TDR -- which is
// how these sessions end.
//
// WHICH TABLE IT READS IS THE WHOLE DETECTOR, and it read the wrong one. It took
// THIS hook's table, and in every private mode that is the EXPOSURE hook's
// private buffer -- vScreen attaches to the context after exposure has already
// moved its vptr. So `now` was the value this file had itself frozen, the
// compare could not fail, and the conclusion drawn from its silence ("STALE
// FORWARD has never been observed, so the frozen copy is harmless") was never
// evidence of anything: it was a load and a compare of one variable against
// itself, on every draw, all session. exposureFixContextTable() hands back the
// bottom hook's table, which IS the one the context holds, in every mode.
//
// AND EVERY SLOT THIS IS CALLED FOR IS ONE THE EXPOSURE HOOK DOES NOT PATCH --
// it takes CSSetShader, CSSetUAVs, Dispatch, DispatchIndirect and ClearState,
// none of which is below. That is what makes `frozen` the runtime's own entry
// rather than a co-owner's thunk; if the two lists ever overlap, this compares
// vScreen's forward against the exposure thunk sitting in the slot and reports a

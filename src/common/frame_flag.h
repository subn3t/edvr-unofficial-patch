// ONE VERDICT PER FRAME, over a channel that carries no frame identity.
//
// The mark above is read once per eye, at each Submit, and it legitimately
// changes DURING a frame: the detector re-decides on every new furthest camera
// and can set, withdraw and re-raise it by design. So a transition landing
// between Submit(left) and Submit(right) shows one eye this frame and the other
// a reprojection of the last one -- a one-frame binocular mismatch, which is
// what a flash feels like. The fix for flashes, producing one.
//
// It cannot be solved by comparing frame numbers, because this channel does not
// carry one (EDVR-31). It is solved by sampling once and making the second eye
// follow, which is available without any protocol change at all.
//
// CONSISTENT-LATE BEATS SPLIT, in both directions. Two eyes showing the previous
// frame is a dropped frame, which runtimes reproject and people are used to. Two
// eyes disagreeing is not something either handles.
//
// Header-only and pure, so the property can be asserted without a compositor --
// and shared, so the two copies of the hook cannot drift. compositor_hook.cpp is
// FORKED and its "kept aligned by hand" regions have no mechanical check, which
// is the standing gap in the sync tooling; this is four lines fewer to keep
// aligned by remembering.

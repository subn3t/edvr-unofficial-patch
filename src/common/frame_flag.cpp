// for different layouts on 2026-09-23; the merge of both is _v35.

// the layout -- fssMonoFrames, fssBodyStamp, fssPanelRectRedo, the gaze,
// the compositor's frame timing and EDVR's activity words -- nothing had
// written them since that proxy was deleted; and because the halves now
// sign the roll-call below, so the next mismatch is refused aloud.
// _v33 because the intro panel's recentre request joined (introRecentre),
// for the seated-origin fix in docs/intro-video.md, 2026-09-17.
// _v32 because runtimeKind left the layout -- its only writer was the
// legacy openvr proxy's launch_centre.cpp, deleted with that proxy, and
// nothing native replaced it.
// _v31 because the runtime's hidden-area-mesh triangle counts joined
// (runtimeMaskTri), for fix.eye_mask's auto mode (frame_flag.h).
// _v30 because the detector's verdict on a jump crosses to the openvr half
// (jumpVerdict), which waits for it before restarting the history.
// _v29 because the head lock's two angles are packed with a bias that fits
// the field they are masked into; the old pair would read each other's
// angles 409.6 degrees out.
// _v28 because the frame timing sample names its layout (184 or 176) and
// the WaitGetPoses block time crosses for the render thread's busy time.
// _v27 because the frame timing sample is now the SETTLED record (two
// compositor frames back) and carries the compositor's CPU time and the
// poses-ready and frame-ready stamps.
// _v26 because the frame timing sample gained the app's busy time (fpsVR's
// CPU frametime), and the EDVR-activity and head-lock words.
// _v25 because the compositor's frame timing joined, for the menu's
// Monitor page (frame_flag.h, docs/settings-menu.md).
// _v24 because the settings menu's channel joined: the anchor, the
// visibility heartbeat, the drawn counter and the runtime kind
// (frame_flag.h, docs/settings-menu.md).
// _v23 because the eye-tracked gaze joined, for the foveation's moving
// centre (frame_flag.h).
// _v22 because the scene-arrived latch joined, so the cull guard can hold
// off while the intro is up (frame_flag.h).
// _v21 because
// on an assumption of symmetry that a Quest 3 breaks (frame_flag.h).
// _v20 because the game's D3D11 device joined, for the early VR handover
// (since removed; the cull guard's presence test keeps the field).
// _v19 because the head pose joined, for the intro movie's world-space
// panel (intro_panel.h). _v18 because the arrival stamp joined for the
// window-scoped heal. _v17
// added the centring servo's redo counter.
// _v16 carried both eyes' corner sets for the nose-mask stitch. _v15 was one eye's corners, _v14 the 4-float rect,
// _v13 fssBodyStamp, _v12 fssChromeStamp, _v11 fssMonoFrames, _v10
// submitTex. _v9 was
// headForward. _v8 was
// eyeTangents, _v7 cullGuard, _v6 eyeSize, _v5 holdFrames, _v4
// externalCamStamp, _v3 the field before that. A mismatched pair from
// different builds must not agree on a layout they disagree about, and a
